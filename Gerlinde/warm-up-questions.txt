Basic : Adding Navbars
We will continue to improve our example that we re-used on day 1  (from the section "Basic Bootstrap Template") our list of technologies that we know so far - feel free to add Bootstrap components now! Create several different versions of this template with some navbars: use fixed top navbar or fixed bottom navbar in the first version, and create also a responsive inverted/dark navbar in a second version. Feel free to create a few more versions based on your inspiration.
